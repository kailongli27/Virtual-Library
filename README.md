# Virtual-Library
Keep track of your favorite books with this user-friendly tool! You can add as many titles as you'd like and sort them however you want.

Throughout this project, I learned a lot about DOM manipulation with form input values, array manipulation and sorting in Javascript, as well as designing cards and dropdown menus with CSS.
